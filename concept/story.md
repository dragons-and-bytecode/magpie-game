# Setting

A land, separated by a great divide through the middle. A montain-region with
a great wall around the mountain tops.

Through the middle of that wall is a locked door, that is unguarded, but
unpassable (at first).

The player lives in one side of the land, where the people live in a state of
technologie, comparable with the European early middle ages (800-900). They
communicate with the magic and nature.

As the story goes on, the player will find the means, to cross the divide and
visit the other side. The people there live in a much higher technological
state. They are advanced in their technology and are a land of great thinkers
and tinkerers.

As the player travels between the two lands in the later game, he brings about
technologie from the other side and with that, awakens greed in some of the
locals.

This progresses into a peak, where a great battle needs to be fought, which
threatens to devastate the land.

As the battle draws to a close, the player gets a choice. She can seal the
door shut again, allowing the wounds in her land to heal, or leave it open
and solve the issue with laws and regulations. If he chooses the second option,
the land will recover a bit, but greed will not go away and soon the players
people will rise against the Technocrats in a battle that engulfes the whole
world, leaving it a wasteland with very few people surviving.

But maybe those that survived will find a way, to use technologie and magic
in a harmonious way?
